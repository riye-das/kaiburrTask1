# Java REST API Example Documentation

This documentation provides instructions on implementing a Java REST API that allows you to perform the following operations on "server" objects:

1. *GET Servers*
   - Retrieve a list of all servers or a single server by specifying its ID.
   
2. *PUT a Server*
   - Create or update a server by providing a JSON-encoded server object.
   
3. *DELETE a Server*
   - Delete a server by specifying its ID.
   
4. *GET (Find) Servers by Name*
   - Find servers whose names contain a specified string.

The "server" objects will be stored in a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the Java REST API, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Install JDK 8 or higher.

2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Choose an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code for coding and project management.

3. *MongoDB*: Install MongoDB and ensure it's running. You should have a MongoDB instance to store server objects.

4. *Maven or Gradle*: Choose a build tool (Maven or Gradle) to manage dependencies and build your project.

## Project Setup

1. Create a new Java project in your chosen IDE.

2. Configure your build tool (Maven or Gradle) for the project.

3. Set up MongoDB connection details in your project configuration.


## Creating RESTful Endpoints

### Setting Up REST Controllers

Create REST controllers for handling server-related operations. Annotate the controller methods with appropriate HTTP method annotations.

### Handling HTTP Methods

1. Implement methods to handle GET, PUT, and DELETE requests for servers.

2. For GET:
   - Implement the logic to retrieve all servers or a single server by ID.
   - Return a 404 status code if the server is not found.

3. For PUT:
   - Parse the JSON-encoded server object from the request body.
   - Create or update the server in the MongoDB database.

4. For DELETE:
   - Delete the server by ID.

### Request and Response Formats

1. Ensure that your API uses JSON for request and response formats.
   
### Request Validation and Error Handling

1. Implement request validation to ensure that the provided data is valid.

2. Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

### MongoDB Integration

1. Use MongoDB Java drivers to connect to your MongoDB instance.

2. Create a "server" collection in the database to store server objects.


## Postman or Curl Testing

To test your API, you can use Postman or Curl:

- Use Postman to send GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST requests to your API endpoints.
- Alternatively, you can use Curl commands to interact with your API from the command line.

## Conclusion

You have now implemented a Java REST API with MongoDB integration. This API allows you to perform CRUD operations on "server" objects. Make sure to thoroughly test your API using Postman, Curl, or other HTTP clients to ensure it responds correctly to requests. Additionally, consider further enhancements such as adding authentication and authorization for secure access to your API.
